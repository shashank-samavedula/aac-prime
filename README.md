# Prime Factorization
Implemented and analyzed two Monte Carlo algorithms, Pollard Rho and Brent's Algorithm, for prime factorization of integers in Python. Successfully coded and executed both algorithms, leveraging Monte Carlo techniques to efficiently identify and analyze prime factors. Conducted a thorough analysis of algorithmic performance, evaluating factors such as time complexity, precision, and accuracy in factorization results.
